        When it encounters an enemy that’s truly mighty, this Pokémon removes
        the power-save belt from its waist and unleashes its full power. Omanyte
        lived in the seas of antiquity. Its fossils have been found bearing bite
        marks from Archeops, so apparently Archeops preyed on it. It has no
        eyeballs, so it can’t see. It checks its surroundings via the ultrasonic
        waves it emits from its mouth.

        When Dustox flaps its wings, a fine dust is scattered all over. This
        dust is actually a powerful poison that will even make a pro wrestler
        sick. This Pokémon searches for food using its antennae like
        radar.Although it still can’t fly, its jumping power is outstanding. It
        jumps way up into trees and plucks the buds from the branches.It’s so
        popular with the elderly that there’s a magazine devoted to this
        Pokémon. Fans obsess over the particular length and angle of its arms.
